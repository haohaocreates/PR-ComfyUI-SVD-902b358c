## Preliminary use of SVD in ComfyUI

DISCLAIMER: I'm NOT a proper coder, this is a very quick hack, installing probably a pain.. but it works for me, so I'll share it.

Requires this repo https://github.com/Stability-AI/generative-models
I simply put it in "generativemodels" folder under ComfyUI folder

I used my existing ComfyUI venv and added whatever requirements was missing.

and the checkpoints from here:
https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-video-diffusion-img2vid
https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-video-diffusion-img2vid-xt
to ComfyUI/checkpoints folder (because I suck and don't know how to change that yet)

With default settings 25 1024x576 frames using svt_xt should run bit under 20GB.

Again, to make it clear, this is experimental and I won't be helping with installation or take any responsibility if you break something using this!
